# Tenzies

Created a Tenzie game and the objective of the game is to get all of the same numbers as quickly as possible

In order to get the same numbers you have to hold numbers and get rolling until all of the same numbers are held, in order to hold a number just click on the number and you will have a green background.

Used React Confetti for a celebration when you get a Tenzie.

I added a Timer that after you get a tenzie will stop

The Dice are randomly changing based on using Math.floor and math.random to choose a number between 1 and 6 and using nanoid to get a random id when you generate a new die

In order to run this project first clone this repo and then run npm i to grab all of the needed packages for this file and then run npm start to play this tenzies game
